# Agentic Product Composer - MVP Boundary Definition

## What This MVP DOES (Core Features)

- **Conversational App Specification**: Users describe their desired web app in natural language (e.g., I need a task manager with drag-and-drop boards)
- **Agent-Driven Code Generation**: Three specialized agents convert requirements into complete React application code
- **Real-time Component Preview**: Live rendering of generated components as they're created, using Tambo-style dynamic rendering
- **Interactive Component Editing**: Users can modify generated components through conversational commands
- **Complete File Structure Generation**: Creates full Next.js project with pages, components, and styling
- **Visual Component Hierarchy**: Displays generated component tree and allows exploration
- **One-Click Local Development**: Generated apps are immediately runnable with `npm run dev`

## What This MVP EXPLICITLY DOES NOT DO

- **No Authentication Systems**: No user accounts, login, or persistent user data
- **No Database Integration**: No external APIs, databases, or backend services
- **No Complex State Management**: No Redux, Zustand, or advanced state patterns
- **No Production Deployment**: No build optimization, CI/CD, or hosting setup
- **No Advanced UI Frameworks**: No Material-UI, Ant Design, or component libraries
- **No Code Review or Optimization**: No performance analysis or code quality suggestions
- **No Multi-Agent Collaboration**: No agent-to-agent communication beyond the core pipeline

## Value Proposition

Transform natural language app descriptions into fully functional React applications through an interactive, agent-driven development experience.

## Demo Narrative

"Watch as I describe a simple e-commerce product catalog in plain English, and our system generates a complete, runnable React application with product cards, filtering, and search - all through conversational interaction and real-time component preview."
